# DiagnosticsTools

A standalone diagnostic tools library for Avalonia UI applications, extracted from the core Avalonia repository.

## About

This project is based on the original `Avalonia.Diagnostics` code from the [AvaloniaUI repository](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia). It has been extracted into a standalone project that uses Avalonia NuGet packages instead of project references, making it easier to develop and maintain diagnostic tools independently.

## Original Source

The original code can be found in the main Avalonia repository:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia
- **Original Location**: `src/Avalonia.Diagnostics`

## License

This project inherits the MIT License from the original Avalonia project.

See [AVALONIA-LICENSE.md](./AVALONIA-LICENSE.md) for the full Avalonia license text.
